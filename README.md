# Relationship Between Happiness and Alcohol - Bayesian Version
Bayesian regression analysis on the Happiness and Alcohol Consumption Kaggle dataset. The traditional, frequentist approach can be located [here](https://github.com/ivan-ronceria/frequentist-happy-alcohol)

We propose a bayesian multivariate regression model in this version with very similar results to the frequentist version of this project.
